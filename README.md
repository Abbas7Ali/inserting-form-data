# inserting-form-data
 This is a mini task creating a basic form and Inserting data in Database
MySQL CRUD Functions using PHP:

I created a basic web form with MySQL CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions implemented in PHP. This allows users to submit data, view existing records, modify entries, and delete information, providing a complete solution for managing data efficiently.

**For testing/learning create your own database and reconnect from database connection function.**
